# BookServiceRestAPI
This application demonstrates the use of cache in Restful web-services  which help to decrease latency rate and increase the throughput.

For caching declaration, Springâ€™s caching abstraction provides a set of Java annotations:

1).@Cacheable: Triggers cache population.

2).@CacheEvict: Triggers cache eviction.

3).@CachePut: Updates the cache without interfering with the method execution.

4).@Caching: Regroups multiple cache operations to be applied on a method.

5).@CacheConfig: Shares some common cache-related settings at class-level.

Extensively used: Java, SpringBoot, JPA, Hibernate, MySql, SpringToolSuit, Mysql, Maven, Postman.
